## Core Features
- User authentication: Checks if the client connecting is providing the correct port and password information. Return proper error message if the information isn't correct.
- Welcoming message: Upon successful client registration, client will recieve the welcoming message from our server, which will have the server's information, such as server name, version, server created time and channel modes.
- Nickname Setting: with /nick <yourNewNick> will change your nickname to your desired new one and alert everyone that you are associated with by channels.
- Join and leave channels: with /join you can join an existing channels or create a new channel. with /part or /leave you can leave your current channels, if you wish to leave multiple channels at once. you can /part #channelname1,#channelname2,...
- Private message: clients are allowed to message other clients privately.
- Setting channel topic: allows the user to set channel topic or to see what the channel topic is
- Channel Mode: with different channel mode flag, as a channel operator, you will be able to set channel information and rules. For example: /mode +i
      - +i/-i: this turns on invite only for this channel
      - +t/-t: -t turns off the restriction that only operator can set channel topic. +t turns the restriction back.
      - +k <passkey>/-k: adds a channel key, which is required for new comer to add to their command upon wishing to join the channel. -k removes the restriction
      - +o <nick>/-o <nick>: gives or takes the user's channel operator privilege.
      - +l <number>/-l : adds a limit to the number of users can be in the channel and the -l removes this restriction
- Clients quitting: When a client quits, our server alerts the rest of the users, they have any association by channels or priv msg.

Interaction between the Server and client

## Usage
Before testing the program, you might want to download irssi, which is our preferred client. [irssi download link](https://irssi.org/download/)
You can test the program by git cloning the project through a terminal and head into the Makefile and make sure you have the correct cflag based on your operating system. Return to the main directory and
```
make
```
After make, you should have the executable called ircserv. You can test the program by entering
```
./ircserv <port> <password>
eg. ./ircserv 6667 4321
```
You should see the following text in the terminal.
```
Server started at Wed Jan 29 12:17:50 2025
Server loop started
```
Now open another terminal and enter the following command. -c stands for connect and w is password and p is port. You can also test it out with different numbers and password to see the error messages.
```
irssi -c localhost -w 4321 -p 6667
```
Upon connecting, you should see this from the server terminal
```
New client connected, socket 4
<< CAP LS
<< PASS 4321
<< NICK josephlu
<< USER josephlu josephlu localhost :Joseph Lu
>> :ircserver 001 josephlu :Welcome to the IRC network josephlu!josephlu@localhost
>> :ircserver 002 josephlu :Your host is ircserver, running version 1.0
>> :ircserver 003 josephlu :This server was created Wed Jan 29 12:21:45 2025
>> :ircserver 004 josephlu ircserver 1.0 ro itkol
>> :ircserver 005 josephlu CHANMODES=i,t,k,o,l :are supported by this server
<< MODE josephlu +i
<< PING ircserver
>> PONG ircserver
```
Now from the irssi/client terminal, you can test out our IRC server!
